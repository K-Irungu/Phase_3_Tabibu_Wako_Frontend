# Descritpion of Project:

Tabibu Wako is an online appoinment booking application that addresses the need for covenience when making an appointment with a medical spceialist. The project comprises a React application that enables its user to:
 - create, read, update and delete appointments
 - view a list of all specialists available to book with. 

This project's backend is developed using Ruby and Sinatra and facilitates the storage of all data related to Doctors, Patients and their Appointments, in a manner modeled after the real worl relationships that would exist between the three entities. 

# How to use the web application
Tabibu Wako's design and layout objectives have been centered on user friendliness and intuitive functionality. The home page comprises a call to action "Book Appointment" which is the essence of the solution provided here. 
Via the Nav bar, the user may navigate to:
- "Our Specialists" - where a list of all specialists available for bookings can be found, along with their respective specialties
- "Book" - where one can create a new appointment with a selected specialist
- "View Appointments" - where one can view all the appointments made. Here, useful functionality has been included that enables the user to edit/update the patient name and/or doctor name for a selected appointment.
